            above and beyond current iPad-based 'distraction' methods 
            for children who undergo painful recurrent medical procedures.

            Link_to shows off the image_tag helper which takes arguments the path to an image and an optional
            options hash, setting the alt attribute of the image tag using symbols.
            Alt attribute will display the text if there is no image.
            This is required by HTML standard.
            Rails does this automatically (the text is the image filename) if alt tag is not included.
